/* 

Arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that
 the difference between each consecutive term is constant, 
  commonly denoted by d.

For example:

3, 5, 7, 9, ...

Here, the first term, a = 3 , and the common difference, d = 2 .

In general, AP is  a, a+d , a+2d, ... , a+(n-1)d


So , sum of AP is :  a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + ... + (a+(n-1)d)

Or, sum of 'n'th term  = (n/2)(2a+(nâˆ’1)d)
